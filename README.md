# Guessing-Game-in-c#-
Just a simple guessing game in made in c# for fun.

If you are a beginner and want to try recreating these.

Here are some simple steps:

We want to create a guessing game where the user has to input a random number 1 out of 100

First use a Console.WriteLine to explain to the user what the game is about and how it works

Then make a Console.ReadLine so that the number inputed from user can be read.

Each guess will be counted. (The guess will be counted in the backgroun, once guessed correct it will show)

If user gets the wrong number they will have to guess again (With a prompt message telling them to guess again)

If user gets the wrong number lower than the correct number (They will be promt with a message saying your number is too low guess again)

If user gets the wrong number higher than the correct number (They will be promt with a message saying your number is too high guess again)

If user gets the correct number (Prompt message will say Congratualtions you have guessed correctly)

Once Guessed corrected user will also recieve (Prompt message of how many guess it took for them to guess correctly)

Finally once they have guessed correctly we can setup a (Press Random Key) to exit the game.



Simple. Have a try and enjoy.
